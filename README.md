# Mini

Mini is a template & tool akin to Kirimase aimed at providing customization options for the UI instead of the backend-for-frontend, which could result in a paradox of choice where you have more engagement for the project but less actual builders.

The idea is that you use the CLI to swap components and then code in an MVC fashion. This way, not only do you "code at the speed of light", but you also have a minimal-viable-product to show off to your clients in no time, customized of course.
